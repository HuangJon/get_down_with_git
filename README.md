# OVERVIEW
* what is source control and why is it important. 
* Touch on other source control options and hosts. 
* Source control is one aspect of professional deploy cycle -- works hand in hand with continuous integration and the code review process. 
* It's more than just checking in code, it's leaving a breadcrumb trail for ourselves and our partners to understand how and why we constructed things the way we did. Great for your upcoming team project!

#REVIEW: 
* review of basic git idiom

SEE HOW IT IMPROVES YOUR WORKFLOW: companion to existing best practices around "test a little, write a little". 
Gives you lots of beak points. 'git reset' to previous working commit. 
'git log', 'git reflog'. 
Get's stuff off your machine! 
Build your portfolio for interviewing!

#FOR YOUR TEAM/PROFESSIONALLY: 
git flow
branch management 
merging and resolving merge conflicts 
stash
squashing 
rebasing
working with different forks maybe 

#FOR OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS: 
Branches are used to manage not just feature creation but also the life cycle and continued development of many projects. 
Shout out to how open source projects like the development of Rust http://2016.phillyemergingtech.com/session/stability-without-stagnation-lessons-learned-shipping-ember/.
SUMMARY: It's a handy, essential tool that you can use today to improve your development experience.
